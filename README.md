# Movie-Recommendation-System
This project is a Movie Recommendation System that helps users find movies based on their preferences by utilizing machine learning techniques. Built using Python and popular libraries like Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and Streamlit, this system provides personalized movie suggestions through collaborative filtering and content-based filtering methods.

###Key Features:
*Content-Based Filtering: Recommends movies based on similarities in genres, keywords, and other attributes.
*Collaborative Filtering: Suggests movies by identifying patterns in user preferences and movie ratings.
*Cosine Similarity for Recommendations: Implements Cosine Similarity to measure similarity between movies, improving recommendation accuracy.
*Simple Web Interface: The system includes a user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit, allowing users to input preferences and get instant movie recommendations.
###Technology Stack:
*Programming Language: Python
*Libraries/Frameworks: Scikit-Learn, Streamlit, Pandas
*Recommendation Techniques: Bag of Words, Cosine Similarity
###How to Run:
1.Clone the repository.
2.Install the required packages listed in requirements.txt.
3.Run the Streamlit app using streamlit run app.py.
This project demonstrates the basics of recommendation algorithms and provides a foundation for building more advanced recommendation systems.
